angucomplete-alt
============

This is a fork of angucomplete-alt (https://github.com/ghiden/angucomplete-alt) with the following changes:

* Added enter-key-pressed argument which is a callback for enter key down event.
* Removed any other key-down behavior (prevents list keyboard navigation).
* Send list item index to selectedObject callback.
